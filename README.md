# ðŸ¤– Hi!
I'm currently a Project Manager for a team of developers working on a GTA RP server. While I manage the project, I also love coding and learning more about cybersecurity and computer networks. In my free time, I work on a few personal projects, like the Discord bots I've built using Python and the discord.py library, which I share here as a hobby.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: LUA, Python, C#, some HTML/CSS & JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Frameworks**: FiveM (for scripting), .NET (C#)
- **Tools**: Git, Visual Studio, VS Code, FiveM Server, F8 Developer Console (for debugging and testing), RCC (for client-side resource management)
- **Cybersecurity**: Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Analysis, Networking, Ethical Hacking

## ðŸ‘¾ Currently Learning

- **Advanced Cybersecurity**: Network security, ethical hacking, and malware analysis.
- **Python and C#**: Creating basic discord bots using discord.py and trying to automate tasks related to networking.
